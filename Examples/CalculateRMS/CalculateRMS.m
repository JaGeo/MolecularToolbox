% The script does not work if the atoms of the two POSCARs are sorted differently!

% Just define the relative pathways of the sorted POSCARs and the

% What is actually done here?
% A object called RMS1 of the type RMS is instantiated. Therefore, the pathways of two POSCARs are needed. Then, its method printFileRMSandRMSxyz is called with the pathway of the OUTPUT-file.

try
    RMS1=RMS(PathwayPOSCAR1,PathwayPOSCAR2);
    RMS1.printFileRMSandRMSxyz(filenameOUTPUT);
    disp('No error. All files are created :).')
    
    
    %That is why you get an error message.
